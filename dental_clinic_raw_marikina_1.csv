 for wisdom tooth removal -- which also turned out great and painless!

He is excellent at what he does and also takes the time to explain each step of the procedure.
 The staff is also very accomodating and responsive through their Facebook page.

Their office is clean and scheduling for an appointment is very easy! Highly recommended!


So satisfied with the cosmetic work done at Paz Dental Center! The results are outstanding.
 The attention to detail and skill of their cosmetic team is top-notch. My smile has been 
transformed, and I couldn't be happier. Highly recommend their cosmetic services! 
Thankyou Paz Dental Center for bringing back my smile 😁😁


Staffs are accomodating. The clinic is clean and cozy, the only problem is that they are 
not careful. I only went for a usual cleaning. As soon as I got home, I noticed the fillings
 in my front teeth got destroyed. I complained right away, seen my message, promised 
to get back on me but to no avail. They didn't even apologize for it. So I'm not gonna 
come back here. Not recommending this to anyone.

SOBRANG RECOMMENDED! 💯
Friendly and accommodating lahat ng staff from the receptionist hanggang sa dentist.
Napakagaan pa ng kamay ng dentista, 2 wisdom teeth tinanggal sakin pero wala akong naramdamang pain.
 Very smooth yung process, at mabilis. Tatanungin ka from time to time kung may masakit, or kung okay ka
 lang, kung gusto mo magrest, etc.
Sobrang 👌🏻 pa yung hindi sila nag-ooverprice at hindi bawat kilos mo may bayad.
They’ll be my 4th, and probably the last clinic na pupuntahan ko.

When HMo is used, the service is not good..you can feel it from the cleaning done..
as for the pasta, the reason is that the materials they use are class A, then HMo only 
charges a little...I hope they don't accept or agree to be accredited. they are from HMo..
I verified with my HMo, they covered the permanent or temporary pasta...the dentist here

First visit I felt that I was in good hands, you immediately know that he’s an expert on what 
he’s doing. I’m grateful that Dr. Mina able to save my front teeth and finally giving me relief 
for almost 2 years of discomfort. I wish I was able to find My Dental Place sooner. I’m so 
grateful and couldn’t be happier with the result.


My family and I have been going to My Dental Space for regular teeth cleaning for years. 
All of them have had braces and the results are astounding!!! My four children, my husband 
and I really like the clinic as it is always clean, fragrant and well-maintained. I love the fresh
 plants and the quaint design of the waiting room😍👍😍 …


Dr. Mina and Mel have been taking care of my teeth for almost 6 years! Their dental
 treatment and services are affordable, very personalized, up-to-date, and of excellent 
quality! Rarely do I get problems with my crowns, root canal and prophylaxis. 
Highly recommended!


Nice to have a very reliable Dentist near our place. After seeing a number of dentists, 
Doc Toto is the only one that was able to truly fix my dental concern.


For me, Doc Toto Mina Jr. is my best dentist so far. The lightness of the hand, quickly pull out the tooth, you will be surprised that in less than 2 minutes your wisdom tooth was pulled out without any pain. And of course the clinic is very neat and cozy😉 …
","My daughters and my nephews loves getting their dental check up at My Dental Space. They will 
relaxed and comfortable in the skillful hands of their friendly dentist.



Doc Toto has been my dentist for me and my family for the past 20 years. Very meticulous and precise 
would describe his treatment. He does not scrimp on materials and is constantly updated on the latest 
techniques, instruments and materials. Because of his light hands, painless shots and engaging personality,
 my children love to visit his clinic.
Oh, by the way, I live in Laguna. It is a very long trip to his clinic but it's worth it.


I live in Arizona but every time I go home to the Philippines  I visit my favorite dentist...Dr. Toto Mina.
 He is my dentist since he was a student at UERM..I was his guinea pig then.😃
My daughter who's now 23 yrs old would rather see Dr. Mina than any dentist in the states. 
We love My Dental Space!!!
5 stars



Dr.Lorenzo Mina has superb workmanship, his hands are light and he works in a meticulous manner that
 you know you can trust. His clinic offers a quiet relaxation as you wait with interiors and music to calm your 
senses, not to mention the cleanliness and sterile materials they handle w utmost care and the friendly smile
 around the clinic, that of Mel's, and of course her precision on your next appointments will tell you that surely you're in the right hands.  And if you're not in a rush, or if the clinic isn't busy, a bonus is the enjoyment of doc's company.  Another plus is doc Van's occassional visit who also takes care of the light mood around the clinic."

 tools and equipment are very clean and up to date. Will definitely go back to her clinic.

 getting advice on aftercare, which I always appreciate. The clinic being clean and beautifully

Thankful for Dra May Manalo for her top notch care.., though nervous about having my first root canal but 
after the procedure i know there was nothing to fear if you let Dra Manalo handle any of your dental problems.
 Excellent work Dra!!! Thanks so much☺️👍


I highly reccomend Manalo Dental Clinic. Dra. May is very professional. Khit yung anak ko hindi natatakot
 na bumalik sa kanya kc magaan ang kamay ni doktora. One time binunutan sya ng ngipin pinakuhanan pa 
nya ng picture habang nililinisan at binubunot yung ngipin nya kasi d nya naramdaman ung sakit. 
Alam nya kung paano ihandle ung situation lalo n sa mga kids. She really takes care of her patients.
 Hindi nya tatapusin ung session until masatisfy ung patient nya.

Just visited Genial Smiles Dental Clinic today and had an exceptional experience from start to finish. 
The clinic's ambiance is warm and welcoming. The staff at the reception were incredibly friendly and efficient,
 making the check-in process smooth and hassle-free. ☺️
Dra. Norhi is a true professional with a gentle touch. She took the time to explain every step of the procedure, 
ensuring I was comfortable and informed throughout. What stood out the most was the personalized care and
 attention I received. She made sure to address all my concerns and questions with patience and expertise. 👌
I highly recommend Genial Smiles Dental Clinic anyone looking for top-notch dental care. Their commitment 
to patient satisfaction and high standards of care make them a standout choice. I will definitely be returning for
 all my future dental needs. 🫰


#FinallyFoundMyLoved! 😁
Highly recommended!
 I have LOTS of anxiety about going to the dentist. After this visit, I have become an advocate. 
Dr. Norilhyn Mae Capuno and to all #GenialSmilesStaff were amazing.
 They made me feel comfortable and I believe the treatment plan is actionable and has my best interest in mind.
No doubt at all they will surely give you an assurances of 100% safe and secure👌

 antiseptic on my mouth - just the right amount of pressure. I could also tell not just by the 
way she talked to me, but to her staff as well, that she is kind and someone you'll feel 
comfortable with. The fee (500) was also among the more affordable ones.

“summary” – My experience was NOT of a medical care facility but, solely a materialistic ,
 money-centric  business that perceived then treated me as just a “punter” to extract as 
much $$$ from with little overall concern for the best outcome for a “patient”.
All Advise given @ naval seemed driven only by their commercial considerations & is 
proven completely false + the workmanship shown 2b pathetically unprofessional .
IF a permanent resident of the Philippines I’d consider initiating legal proceedings against 
this BUSINESS for breach of duty of care.

The story-
Initial doubts arose immediately during the consultation.  Got told in(a grave tone) that 
‘19’ teeth needed attending to.   19!??
My radar went bleep perceiving a potential wallet gouge - as, the previous (then unavailable
 Filipino dentist I’d seen a few months earlier had said ‘1’ tooth filling should be attended to 
and the rest were AOK – had an xray to verify this with.
However that 1 tooth was now a little sensitive (as predicted). This woman at naval was
 near to me & she came-kind of-with a 3rd hand recommendation,,, so I ignored my 
suspicions & chose 2 have her attend to it.
Again, a grave look of ‘salesperson’ concern was displayed with persistent urging 2 
immediately begin root canal treatment then her fitting a crown. $$$! The cost she quoted 
was twice++ what the previous dentist had quoted - and he (1st dentist) had advised filling
 was an acceptable option.  He did warn  filling ‘MAY’ last & if not – root canal work.

So, against the persistently applied pressure, I said filling. This didn’t go down well with her 
and seemingly annoyed began the procedure.  Again I had doubt as to her attending to her
 professional duty of care requirements.

The work was carried out in a rough, rushed manner plus the type of filling material was a runny,
 soft type I’d never seen before. On later inspection this filling material could be seen ‘splashed’ 
onto other teeth.  I paid (comparatively way above Philippine standards) and left after courteously
 managing to evade the persistent propositions for booking subsequent appointments to have the other ‘18’ teeth drilled into.

I’m back home now.  For weeks that tooth was sensitive or painful.  Didn’t feel infected or dying but rather traumatized, bruised.  So, I went to a dentist here 4 advice.

After shooting the xray he began asking ‘WTF’ type questions as to how the tooth got into such a state.  He was appalled at its condition.  It’d been drilled into down to the nerve with the filling applied too thinly directly on top of the nerve – thus the sensitivity & pain. The filling material used was meant as a very temporary type i.e. for a few weeks between procedures & it just won’t last.  He couldn't understand why a trained dentist would use it - perhaps to save money on materials?

His prognosis was that if, initially, the procedure had been conducted with professional, competent care, the tooth –then- would have had enough structure to be ‘correctly’ filled. He advised that because of the work done that now, root canal & crown is ‘possibly’ not an option as the structural integrity seems compromised.

As to the other 18 teeth apparently needing immediate work,, Without explaining I asked him if any other teeth needed attention?  He examined in my mouth again &then the xray - nothing else was required.

To be more certain, I paid for yet another opinion with another dentist and was given the same prognosis –plus a free lecture on the risks involved having work done overseas.

Fortunately the tooth’s sensitivity’s subsided somewhat & is currently just tolerable – until the filling finally fails and/or it shatters.
I disagree with the second dentist - I know from experience there are honest, good dentists in Phil &when the need arises and I’m there I’ll avail upon them again– just this time I’ll search more intently for  one with at least a modicum of professional integrity.

LOL Imagine if  I’d said OK to her  attacking 19 teeth!! WOW!  :P

Hope this helps.",

helpful tips to take care of my teeth.


Hello! I'd like to thank oral confidence because the offer was affordable for continuing my
 braces treatment when I moved since my clinic was too far away. We are really looking for 
something that can be done for some reasons and I want to thank you doc ​​because his 
hands are light :) I also appreciate the fact that I have a schedule for the adjustment of
 braces and the fact that he said when I will possibly lose my braces is exciting haha 
thank you oral confidence.


The facilities are well-maintained and clean plus their very professional and hospitable 
staff! 💗 Thank you! …


If I could give zero star, I would. The last time I went, one of the dentists who was having a 
hard time filling up my teeth, blatantly said to me ""bakit kasi ganyan ang ngipin mo?"" 
(English translation: Why is your teeth like that?""). She was so rude to me, I'm not going 
back there again. She was just frustrated on making sure my teeth aligns right after the 
fillers has hardened, and when it's taking her long.. she had to be rude! I could drop names, 
but I'm not. But I'm not coming back here again. Rude dentists.","I highly recommend the painless tooth extraction in this clinic. It was nicely done by Dr. Jas.I didnt even
 felt my tooth was extracted. A 6 star rate.She was very professional  and friendly staffs as well.👍


Highly recommended this Dental Clinic. The Dentists are all great esp doc Jaz, who assisted me and does
 my pasta. Shes so kind, very perfect ung pagkakagawa nya and I'm very satisfied. Can' t wait na bumalik
 soon for my next session. Very friendly and approachable lahat ng staff. GODBLESS.


Exceeded my expectation. I had trauma when it came to dentist offices but the staff and the dentist was
 very accommodating. I will come back and I highly recommend for anyone looking for a dentist to try here


I had to wait despite having an appointment, but I think I understood why when it was my turn. I was given
 full attention by Dr Jas when I was on the dental chair. Her commitment to quality is commendable. On top 
of that, she is friendly and easygoing."

I will not recommend this clinic. The suffering I endured on my tooth after getting a filling 
there was extreme! The dentist's work was terribly done, and they were in such a rush!
 I got a filling from them, and it fell out after just 4 days. And during the procedure, they 
didn't even bother to ask if I was okay. The tears and agony I went through due to the pain
 were unbearable. Worst dentist ever! What a waste of money! They have no care for their
 patients. I went through such trauma because of you. I'm now scared to have my teeth 
fixed again because of what you did, it's so debilitating. Until now, I can't drink anything 
hot or cold because every time I do, the sensitivity and pain are unbearable. I haven't 
returned because of your botched job, which caused me so much trauma at your dental clinic.","Ambait ni Doc! She made things simple kahit feeling ko ang complicated ng problema ko, hehe.
 Great job and God bless! ♥️

Based on my 2nd appointment, hindi nalinis ng maayos yung teeth ko. Hindi rin maayos yung pagpasta 
sa akin. Mukhang nagmamadali si Doc e. Nakakagat ko yung pasta kapag kumakain ako. E paano once

 has a very gentle hands and didn't feel uncomfortable or pain during the whole procedure. 
She also walked me through our treatment plan.

The clinic is clean and feels relaxing. Patients wore PPE because of the pandemic and it's
 an extra layer of protection; it's an assurance that everything is safe.

The location is kinda tricky. I used google map but I was directed at the back of the building. 
Google map is not updated, try using waze.

Just make sure to set an appointment before coming in. You can message them on
 Facebook or the number they provided.","Offers competitive prices but delivers quality service. very responsive to all inquires, has accomodating

Very disappointed with Smile Makers Marikina Branch. 
I did cleaning and pasta but just cleaning is annoying. It's like it's just added flouride to say it's clean.
 Then my pasta, not even polished, was rough. The tooth that I am brushing is still thinning
 but the adjacent tooth is thickening. When I told the dentist, he said that there was
 nothing that could be done. Like, whaaaaaat? The dentist is old but seems like an amateur.

I had a very great time with Amana Dental Medical Clinic. I was immediately scheduled. 
They also sent a screenshot of the calendar invite of my appointment which I appreciated.
Arrived a little earlier than my schedule, I was welcomed and immediately seated. 
I was also asked to complete the paperwork right away. Since I was using my HMO to avail services,
 they explained what and how much was covered thoroughly to me. 
During the procedure, it didn't feel scary at all. Dr. Marlyn really ensured that the experience 
was pleasant. She was very jolly and had a very nice personality! I love her a whole lot.
 She went above and beyond the cleaning -- maximizing my HMO coverage and did the
 procedures that I need immediately.

My journey towards restoration has been nothing short of transformative, thanks to their expertise and the comfortable environment they provide. Very aesthetic place plus very jolly peeps! Highly recommended!


I had my cleaning procedure and I must say, it was a highly recommended experience! Doc Kate along with the dental staffs Ms. Jane and Ms. Sheine, were incredibly approachable and made me feel at ease throughout the entire process. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly by them and made to feel comfortable in the waiting area.
Once in the chair, Dr. Kate took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure and address any concerns I had. Their expertise and professionalism were evident, and I felt confident in their care. During the cleaning, both Ms. Jane and Ms. Sheine were attentive and made sure I was comfortable at all times.
Overall, I can't recommend this branch enough! The combination of skilled professionals, a welcoming atmosphere, and top-notch care make it the go-to choice for dental needs. Thank you, Doc. Kate, Ms. Jane, and Ms. Sheine for a fantastic experience!"

 staff are warm and welcoming. They accommodated me despite the short notice. Dr. Nica is
 very professional, she takes time to explain what needs to be done and goes the extra mile to make

no complications at all. Safe to say, all expectations were S U R P A S S E D.

The staff is friendly, but the service is poor. I want to share my experience, and I expect that this 
clinic has better offers than others. Before I do their dental cleaning, I ask about the price. It ranges
 between 800-1100, but right after they saw my teeth, they told me that it cost 1500. Yeah, I agreed
 because I'm already there and the offers is too expensive and it will cost you more than other clinics.

My recommendation is that before you accept the services, make sure that the price is clear.

This is my mouth after the cleaning, and as you can see, there are some teeth that are still not cleaned. 
The doctor recommended that I go back next month to do another cleaning for them to be able to 
make sure that my teeth are clean.","Very satisfied. Accommodating staffs. Good service. A bit pricey but worth it. My son didn't feel 
the any pain after tooth extraction up to healing process and the outcome is great. We'll back soon.

If you care about your teeth and want to avoid the nightmare I went through, stay far away from 
Patricio Dental Plaza, owned by Drs. Ernest and Lhannie Patricio, with branches in Ayala Feliz Mall, 
SM City Masinag, and Quezon City. I went to their clinic for a root canal and veneers consultation. 
The 2 doctors confirmed that I indeed needed a root canal based on my x-ray. I also went in for the 
veneers with the explicit instruction to Dr. Lhannie that I chose composite veneers instead of
 porcelain veneers because there was no tooth shaving involved. She assured me there won't be any
 tooth shaving. For these procedures, I went to the clinic 3 times, and each visit took more than 7 hours.
 (That's how you know they're unskilled and don't know what they're doing. The root canal retreatment 
took 45 minutes in the US.) Let me first talk about the root canal done by Dr. Ernest Patricio. The root
 canal took nearly 2 hours, and I thought everything was okay. The long procedure left me thinking it 
was done correctly. However, upon my return to the US in February 2024, I experienced excruciating pain.
 Shockingly, my US dentist revealed that NO ROOT CANAL was performed. An endodontist later confirmed 
this, saying that Dr. Patricio came close to drilling the canal but gave up, sealing my tooth in bad faith.
 This deceitful behavior endangered my health and left me financially burdened with the cost of a
procedure that never happened. The nightmare continued with my composite veneers, which deteriorated 
within 3 months, leading to exposed enamel and heightened sensitivity. The discovery that my teeth had 
indeed been shaved during the botched procedure added insult to injury. Now, I'm left with no choice 
but to seek porcelain veneers, incurring further expenses due to the clinic's incompetence. I can never 
get back what I lost (see pics below of before and after). Their dental advices were also wrong. 
Dr. Lhannie suggested I refrain from flossing with my composite veneers and even recommended
 using baking soda to clean them, a practice universally frowned upon by dental professionals due
 to its abrasive nature. They will also try to upsell procedures or devices you don't need. Dr. Lhannie 
sold me a device to correct my nonexistent TMJ problem, which cost P30,000. My US dentist said I didn't have TMJ. Despite my attempts to address these issues with Patricio Dental Plaza and seek a partial refund (total cost was P450,000) for their negligence, they have chosen not to respond. Your teeth deserve better care than what you'll get there. Save yourself the headache and find a skilled dentist.",

Not a good experience when my daughter was here for braces adjustment and tooth filling/pasta.
- dentist was not aware the she needs to prioritize the front teeth to stabilize the braces and she insisted to do molar, while we have a clear instructions from the owners and chart stated that the front should be priority.
- after brace adjustment, in just 1 hr or less it loosen up and it was uneasy for my daughter, then we need to go back to fix it, however, the same dentist was annoyed about our complain and she wanted us to charge again where in fact it was a back job or should I say a lousy job.
- after doing a filling/pasta she doesn't even bother asking the patient if it's not rough anymore and just said it's done. While settling the bills, my daughter complain that it's still rough under the teeth, so another back job or should I say lousy job from the same dentist.

When I was waiting for my turn, there was a kid around 3-4 yrs old having tantrums in the clinic. The staff approached the kid and gave her candies and changed the TV show to Cocomelon. The kid was then pacified and the mother was very thankful.

I've consistently experienced significant wait times despite arriving punctually for my scheduled
 appointments. It's frustrating to carve out time in my day only to end up waiting for hours past 
my appointment time before being seen by the dentist. The staff is friendly, and the quality of care
is top-notch, but the issue of long wait times needs to be addressed to improve the overall patient
experience. I hope the clinic can implement measures to streamline their scheduling process and
reduce wait times in the future.


The dentists are quick to adjust braces and do prophylaxis. But even if it is still scheduled on their
online link, you will still have to wait at least 1 hour to be accommodated. It's been one year since 
we were transferred to the Marikina branch from the closed Gilmore branch, and the time is always
not followed whether it's a morning slot or even late in the afternoon. Reason? There were a lot of
people and we moved the time to the next one. Then the dentist will have lunch outside the clinic.
You are embarrassed to cry because ""sir, let's have lunch first because we haven't eaten yet"", you 
have no choice but to say yes. There is really a lack of manpower and then it's just sorry. Even if it's
always like that a few times. Hopefully this year my braces will be finished and I won't be coming
 back here.",

Thank you, RA Dental Clinic and Dra. Kharla Ragamat, for a great dental care experience and service! 
I am one of their regular patients, as they did my braces, tooth extraction, regular prophylaxis, and just my

 questions all the time.She is also very gentle and careful not to hurt her patients. I've been wanting to

 the dentists are super nice and service is worth paying.
** 2022, we went back, the receptionists are then pleasant and with good client service.


No respect for patient's time. I had seven scheduled sessions with them (root canal and bleaching)
 and waited an hour for each session before being accomodated.It's pretty much useless to have
 a scheduling system if it won't be followed anyway.I'd suggest for a different clinic for your dental needs.


The staffs are not accommodating and the dentist will laugh like a bipolar and suddenly scream if 
you don't hear him properly. And this is for hmo users, when you apply, they will say that it is not 
card coverage, but they can do it as long as you declare that you are applying for 5 teeth. Was 
able to go to different dental clinics and this is the worst when it comes to customer service but
 the quality is fine the only problem is that everyone seems to be angry in a room and it seems
 like you are not welcome and there is no receipt they asked for 300 pesos for covid preventive
 measure. I hope you fix it. Thank you",

Attached is a screenshot of the form they send to people who book appointments. They don't accept

next to Tañong bakery. There's a furniture/woodshop on the ground floor of the building and a signage 
above for Merlyn Spa. The clinic is on the 2nd floor. Just walk up the stairs.

I like their professionalism and safety measures. They give everyone PPEs (small fee included for it),
 down to the hair cap and foot covers and clear goggles and their own masks (so remove the original 
you came with), all to be discarded after the service. A small local business that's worthy of promoting.
They have several dentists working here, not just one. Fees are reasonable, too. They accept Gcash 
and credit cards. Parking might be a challenge.",
